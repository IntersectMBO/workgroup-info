## CLI/API working group meeting #4
**Date: 02/10/2024**  
**Problem statements/questions/requests:**
- Next item to prioritize: 
  - [Proactive protection against GovAction deposit losses](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/issues/900)
    - The check should live in "transaction build".
    - "build-raw" should remain as is.
  - [Update "query stake-address-info"](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/issues/954) so that it shows action deposits and pool deposits.
