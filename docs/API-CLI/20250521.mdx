## CLI/API Workgroup Meeting Summary
**Date: 21/05/2025** 
**Topics/Problem statements/questions/requests:**

#### ‚öôÔ∏è CLI Standardization

- Recent changes in the CLI have focused on standardizing output formats. 
- The output format is now prefixed with "output" (e.g., JSON, YAML). 
- This standardization aims for consistency across the CLI. 
- JSON is now the default output for query commands. 

#### ‚ú® New CLI Features and Deprecations

- CIP 129 support has been added for committee keys, DREPs, and governance actions. 
- Extended pool operator key support is now included. 
- Plutus offline cost calculation is available in the CLI. 
- GHC 8.10.7 has been deprecated. 
- This deprecation will require updating build documentation. 

#### üîÑ API Updates and Experimental API

- The API has received updates similar to the CLI, including CIP 129 support and the offline calculation command. 
- General refactoring and removal of dead code have been performed on the API. 
- A new experimental API is being introduced. 
- The experimental API aims to simplify the API by focusing on the current mainnet era and the upcoming experimental era, which will reduce complexity and maintenance. 
- A clear deprecation plan for the old API needs to be developed, and community input is sought for this process. 

#### üåê gRPC Interface for Cardano Node

- This interface will allow applications in various programming languages to interact with the Cardano node. 
- There's an alignment with the UTXO RPC specification by TXPipe
- The possibility of creating a CIP to standardize it is being considered. 
- This initiative is believed to contribute to node diversity and improve `cardano-node` usability. 

#### üß© Wasm Support for Cardano API

- Work is ongoing to explore the creation of a JavaScript library based on the master module. 
- Popular Cardano-related browser libraries are also being assessed. 
- The Wasm effort is still in its early stages compared to the gRPC project, which has a clearer path due to defined specifications. 

#### üóìÔ∏è Next Steps

Mateusz Ga≈Ça≈ºyn will start working on the gRPC interface for Cardano node this or next week, following the UTXO RPC specification.
