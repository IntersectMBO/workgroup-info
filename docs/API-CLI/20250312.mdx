## CLI/API working group meeting summary 
**Date: 12/03/2025**
**Topics/Problem statements/questions/requests:**

#### 🔧 Hardware Wallets & Transaction Ordering
- Hardware wallets require a specific ordering of transaction body fields; the current CLI does not enforce this.
- A workaround using `cardano-hw-cli` (by Vacuum Labs) is available to transform transactions into the expected format.
- This is not considered urgent due to the availability and ease of the workaround.
- The existing issue will be relabeled as "hardware wallet support" for clarity.
- Further investigation may be needed to ensure no other compatibility issues exist beyond field ordering.

#### 📦 Cardano-API Refactor & Modularization
- The script for witnessing API refactor is nearing completion.
- This refactor is a prerequisite for enabling a modular structure in `cardano-api`.
- Once complete, it will support more haddocks and better developer documentation.

#### 🌐 gRPC Exploration
- The team is evaluating whether to implement gRPC internally.
- A community proposal funded via Catalyst is already working on this.
- Current focus is on identifying real user needs rather than choosing a solution too early.
- JSON-RPC + WebSocket is also being used in the ecosystem.

#### 🛠️ CLI Output Schema Specification
- Work on CLI output schemas is temporarily paused due to planning tasks.
- It remains a priority and is actively being requested (e.g., by the Blueprints project).
- Work will resume after the current planning cycle.

#### 🚀 Cardano-Testnet Tool
- A local Cardano testnet launcher tool is approaching its v1 release.
- It allows users to spin up a testnet with default mainnet parameters (faster epochs/slots).
- Aimed at DApp developers, educators, and testers.
- Tool will be released with documentation and tutorials.
- Feedback will guide ongoing development and maintenance.

#### 📅 Meeting Frequency Update
- Meetings will shift from bi-weekly to monthly going forward.
- This change is expected to bring:
  - More substance to each meeting.
  - Increased participation.
- Calendars and invites will be updated accordingly.

#### 🧩 CIP129 Support
- CIP-129 is currently in progress.
- The team is improving its process for tracking and responding to CIPs.
